<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jyotsna, and I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (CSAI)
  from Netaji Subhas University of Technology (NSUT). With a strong foundation in academics, I successfully cracked the JEE Advanced 2023
  examination and secured a seat at IIT BHU. However, my keen interest in the CSAI program led me to choose NSUT, 
  where I believe I can better align my education with my career aspirations.</p>

<p>I am dedicated to expanding my skill set and am actively learning Web development, Python, C++,
   and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++. These skills are essential for my goal of becoming proficient 
   in both software development and artificial intelligence. I enjoy the process of coding and problem-solving, finding great 
   satisfaction in overcoming challenges and building efficient solutions.</p>
   

<p>With a strong passion for technology, I am eager to apply my knowledge and contribute to innovative projects. 
  I am constantly seeking opportunities to grow and collaborate with like-minded individuals. By combining my technical skills
   with my drive for excellence, I aim to make meaningful contributions to the field of computer science and artificial intelligence</p>
